## Why this project and a chat platform?
In this era of the social media craze and internet age, where smartphones have become a core part in peoples' lives. And with millions monthly active users on advanced chat apps such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram etc, we (consumers) have started taking these awesome features as for granted. This have become a trouble and headache for indie developers (especially those who provide development services or freelancing) to create such feature-rich platforms in constrained time.

So, *ChatAir* is an open-source feature-rich chat platform (initially for Android) using Firebase's Cloud Firestore database as backend. Android Developers can easily use this platform in their apps and integrate highly advanced feature-rich chat system within a short time. 

## Why Cloud Firestore?
Cloud Firestore is an extended feature of Google Firebase and a real-time document-collection based database service that is an excellent choice if you don’t want to host your own server. With Firestore, you can have our demo chat app setup and running in under 30 minutes. Firestore has a powerful dashboard that gives you access to your data and a REST API if you need to access data from your server. Some of the advantages of Cloud Firestore include:
 * Self-Hosted
 * Scalable
 * Flexible Authentication
 * Realtime & Fast
 * Pay as you go including Free Tier
 * Cross platform SDKs
